 ## Overview

This project was developed as a class project for the Emerging Technologies course. This project served as a simple proof of concept that meant to implement blockchain technology in the Honduran electoral process. The complete theoretical part can be found [here](https://unitechn-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/zunigajose21_unitec_edu/EYqkyFSnhEdAv9F85zHhbpYBtPR_lK1r4z1HH4Fl2hPnqw?e=JFJyxu) (disclaimer: itÂ´s in Spanish).

The main goal was to design a solution that would prevent digital tampering, while also deterring physical tampering, of official electoral documents which have been a big problem in previous electoral processes in Honduras.

The proposed solution involved storing the scanned images of these documents in IPFS and developing a very simple Smart Contract that would store the IPFS hash along with some metadata on the Ethereum blockchain. This proof of concept runs locally with the help of tools like gnash. Instructions on how to run can be found [here](https://github.com/ZunigaJose/Haba_Enlazada/tree/main/client#readme).
